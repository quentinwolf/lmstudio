This script is incredibly basic and will take the old format of ones LM Studio conversations (From prior to 0.3.0) and converts them to the new format, retaining all information including the Pre/System Prompt, Settings, as well as Model used.

It simply requires an Input and Output directory and prompts as such:

```Enter the directory containing old LM Studio chat files:```

```Enter the directory to save converted files:```

Under Windows, just use the standard folder path,  D:\Path_to_your\Old_LM_Studio\Conversations

I'd recommend using different paths for the Old chat files, and where to save the converted files to keep backups (just in case).
